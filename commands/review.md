# Review Proposal Command

Please review the proposal document at `{{file}}` for architectural compliance and security concerns.

First, use the architecture-reviewer subagent to validate the proposal.

After the architecture review is complete, use the security-reviewer subagent to analyze the same proposal document for potential security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and security best practices.
